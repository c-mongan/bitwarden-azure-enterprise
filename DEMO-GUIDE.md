```bash
# Show containers running
docker ps

# Access web vault
open https://localhost
# (Accept certificate warning)
```

**2. Azure Enterprise Application**

- Show "Bitwarden SAML" application 
- Point out SAML configuration

**3. Technical Architecture**
```bash
# Show configuration files
ls -la *.json *.py *.sh

# Show Azure CLI integration
az rest --method GET --uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/0261697c-356d-4711-8660-8b18c89dec8f" --query "displayName"
```

### Key Talking Points

**"I built a complete enterprise identity integration that demonstrates..."**

âœ… **Azure AD SAML Configuration**: "Created Enterprise Application programmatically using Azure CLI"

âœ… **Infrastructure as Code**: "Entire deployment is automated - no manual portal clicking"

âœ… **Security Best Practices**: "SSL certificates, secret management, container security"

âœ… **Enterprise Architecture**: "This is the exact same pattern Bitwarden customers use"

## Demo Flow Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
*"I built a complete Bitwarden enterprise integration that shows how customers deploy identity management in production."*

### Technical Demo (2 minutes)
1. **Show running environment**: "Here's the full stack running locally"
2. **Azure integration**: "I created this Enterprise Application entirely via CLI"
3. **Configuration files**: "All automated with infrastructure as code"

### Architecture Overview (2 minutes)
*"This demonstrates the complete integration pattern:*
- *Azure AD as identity provider*
- *SAML 2.0 for authentication*
- *Containerized deployment with monitoring*
- *Certificate management and security*"

### Business Value (30 seconds)
*"This reduces customer deployment time from weeks to hours and ensures consistent, secure configurations."*
