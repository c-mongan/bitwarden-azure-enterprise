- ✅ Secrets management via environment files

### 4. **Monitoring & Observability**
- ✅ Container health monitoring
- ✅ Application log aggregation
- ✅ API endpoint validation
- ✅ Configuration verification scripts

## 📊 Enterprise Integration Patterns Demonstrated

### SAML SSO Flow
```
User Login → Azure AD → SAML Assertion → Bitwarden → User Authenticated
```

### User Provisioning (SCIM Ready)
```
Azure AD User Changes → SCIM API → Bitwarden → User/Group Sync
```

### Certificate Management
```
Self-Signed Certs → Azure Key Vault → Let's Encrypt → Production Certs
```
