# Enterprise Bitwarden Integration with Azure AD

A production-ready enterprise identity integration demonstrating automated Bitwarden deployment with Azure AD SAML SSO, Docker containerization, and infrastructure-as-code principles.

## Overview

This project implements a complete enterprise password management solution with Microsoft Azure AD integration, addressing real-world challenges organizations face when deploying self-hosted Bitwarden instances with enterprise authentication requirements.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Bitwarden Self-Hosted**: Enterprise password management platform
- **Azure AD SAML Integration**: Single sign-on authentication
- **Docker Containerization**: Consistent deployment environment
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Scripted deployment and configuration
- **SSL/TLS Security**: Automated certificate management

### Key Features
- Automated Azure AD Enterprise Application creation via Azure CLI
- SAML 2.0 authentication with proper claims mapping
- Docker-based deployment with health monitoring
- Infrastructure-as-code for reproducible environments
- Comprehensive documentation and testing procedures

## Quick Start

### Local Development Environment
```bash
# Generate SSL certificates
./generate-ssl.sh

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access at https://localhost
```

### Azure Cloud Deployment
```bash
# Infrastructure provisioning
./scripts/01-azure-infrastructure.sh

# Docker installation and configuration
./scripts/02-docker-installation.sh

# Bitwarden deployment and setup
./scripts/03-bitwarden-setup.sh
```

## Enterprise Integration Features

### SAML SSO Configuration
- Microsoft Azure AD Enterprise Application integration
- Automated SAML metadata exchange
- Claims mapping for user attributes
- Session management and security policies

### Security Implementation
- SSL/TLS certificate automation with Let's Encrypt
- Secure container networking with Docker networks
- Environment-based secrets management
- Network security group configuration

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Container health monitoring
- Automated backup procedures
- Update and maintenance scripts
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails

## Business Value

This implementation demonstrates enterprise-grade deployment patterns that organizations require for production password management solutions, including:

- **Reduced Deployment Complexity**: Automated setup reduces implementation time
- **Enterprise Security Standards**: SAML SSO integration meets corporate requirements
- **Scalable Architecture**: Container-based deployment supports growth
- **Operational Efficiency**: Infrastructure-as-code enables consistent environments

## Documentation

- [Local Deployment Guide](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Azure Cloud Setup](docs/02-implementation-guide.md)
- [SAML Configuration](docs/03-saml-sso-guide.md)
- [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/04-troubleshooting-guide.md)

## Technology Stack

- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Identity Provider**: Azure AD/Entra ID
- **Authentication**: SAML 2.0
- **Infrastructure**: Azure CLI, ARM templates
- **Security**: SSL/TLS, Let's Encrypt

## Requirements

- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of Docker and containerization
- Familiarity with Azure AD/Entra ID administration
- Domain name for production deployment (optional: sslip.io for testing)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Azure CLI installed and configured
2. Docker and Docker Compose installed
3. Valid Azure subscription
4. Domain name or sslip.io for DNS resolution

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Infrastructure Deployment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd enterprise-bitwarden-integration

# Configure Azure infrastructure
./scripts/01-azure-infrastructure.sh
```

#### 2. Container Setup
```bash
# Install Docker on Azure VM
./scripts/02-docker-installation.sh

# Configure Bitwarden services
./scripts/03-bitwarden-setup.sh
```

#### 3. Azure AD Integration
```bash
# Create Enterprise Application
az ad app create --display-name "Bitwarden SAML"

# Configure SAML settings
python configure-saml.py
```

## Security Considerations

- All secrets managed through environment variables
- SSL/TLS encryption enforced for all communications
- Network security groups restrict access to necessary ports only
- Container isolation provides additional security layers
- Regular security updates automated through maintenance scripts

## Performance and Scalability

- Container-based architecture allows horizontal scaling
- Database persistence ensures data reliability
- Load balancing capabilities for high availability
- Monitoring integration provides performance insights

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Certificate renewal automation
- Security patch application
- Backup verification and testing
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions documented in the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/04-troubleshooting-guide.md).
